# T1 Diabetes SNP Search Tool
##  Software Development Project - Team Vivaldi

## Description
'T1 Diabetes SNP search' is a tool we have created as part of our MSc Bioinformatics Software Development Group Project. 
Team members are Marta, Khadija, Thuvarahgan, Jiang and Tobi. 

The aim of this project was to produce a functioning web-based software tool that allows users to search and explore genetic variants that have been associated with high susceptibility of Type 1 Diabetes. The tool also retrieves genomic information and integrates it with population data and functional information.





## Environment setup and Dependencies

1. Install [virtualenv](https://pypi.org/project/virtualenv/) in global Python:

```shell
pip install virtualenv
```

2. Create virtual environment:

```shell
python -m venv venv
```

3.1 Source the environment (on Mac):
```shell
source venv/bin/activate
```

3.1 Source the environment (on Windows):
```shell
venv\Scripts\activate
```

4. Install project dependencies:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5. Please freeze your environment if adding new packages:

```shell
pip freeze > requirements.txt
``` 

6. Run the main.py python script:
```shell
python main.py
```
